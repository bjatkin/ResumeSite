    This is a ray tracer and path tracer written as part of my studies as BYU.
    It supports point, area and directional lights, and simple gemetric primitaives
    such as triangles and spheres. Several materials properities are also supported including
    specularity, specular and diffuse colors and transparency. The bounce limit for rays
    can also be be configured. You can learn more about his project and see several example
    images by visiting the github page
