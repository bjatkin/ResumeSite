    AI Dungeon Designer is an exploration into computational creativity designed and devloped by
    <a href="https://github.com/WestRyanK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan West</a> and myself.
    The goal of the system was to create a computational system that could exhibit creative properties.
    The system creates levels for sokoban type puzzle games. The AI currently generates level for
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip's_Challenge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chips Challenge</a> as well as a custom
    game which we created using <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Puzzle Script</a>.
    In addition to creating the system we performed an indepth analisys into how this project
    relates to the field of computational creativity. You can find this write up and the source
    code to this project <a href="https://github.com/bjatkin/dungeon-design" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
