    This project was a multithreaded Java 8 Bitcoin miner which I wrote to better
    understand the technical aspects of the Bitcoin mining protocall.
    Additinally, I focused on making this code easy to understand and so there are
    many know optimization which I chose not to implement in order to preserver the
    simplicity of the code. You can find the full code as well as more informaiton
    on the project
