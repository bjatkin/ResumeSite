   CheckSUM is a usable security application developed by myself and 
   <a href="https://github.com/jarmknecht" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan Armknecht</a> 
   It was developed as a proof of concept system allowing secure, anonomous, communication of users personal information.
   The specific use case presented in the application is age verification for account signups.
   However, the technology demonstrated has the ability to deliever far more than age verification and could be
   used to verify everything from previous employment, to legal status all while ensuring users stay in charge of their own data.
