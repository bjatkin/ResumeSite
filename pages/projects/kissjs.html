    KISSjs is an html pre-processor, JS and CSS bundler, and a JS and CSS minifyer.
    The goal of this tool is not nessisarily to be the best at any one of these categories.
    Rather KISSjs tries to be a simple compiler that does all the basic work needed to make a modern webapp.
    For many modern web project you need WebPack to bundle your code, Babel to minify your code,
    and a web framework like react or angular to get UI components.
    In order to get all this up and running you'll need to install npm and node js and then install hundreads of
    js files in your node_modules folder just to get started. In addition you'll have to write several scripts and 
    configuration files just to get your system to build. All this for even simple projects.
    KISSjs works to avoid much of that by giving you a simple compiler which will process your target HTML file
    and produce sutible html, js and css bundle files. To learn more about this project visit it's github page
