    PeptoGAN was a research project done in colaboration with the BYU
    biology department. Peptides, which are strings of amino acids, exhibit
    many interesting properties. In this research we studied the anti-microbial
    properties exhibited in a large dataset of peptides. Then, using Generative
    Adversarial Networks we generated other peptieds exhibiting antibiotic properties. 
    These results were first evaluated in silico and then final synthesized in
    the lab to verify the effectivness of the technique.
